 Library Management System
We are going to build a project based on Library Management System. 
It keeps track of all information about books in the library, their cost, status and total number of books available in the library.

Create a database named library 
Inside the database library create the following TABLES.

1. Branch 
2. Employee 
3. Books
4. Customer
5. IssueStatus
6. ReturnStatus
